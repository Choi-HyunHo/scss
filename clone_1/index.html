          An ever growing collection<br />
          featuring some of the best scenes<br />
          in horror.
        </h3>
        <p>
          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

          Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
          Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
          recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

            It’s not Horror, it’s Haneke.™ I dare you to watch this film without
            looking away once. I dare you to watch almost any Haneke film
            without looking away. They’re very often confrontational and require
            work on the viewer’s part to decode. I’ve finished Haneke films with
            other people where nobody really agreed on what we all just watched
            (The White Ribbon (2009), which is incredible). The Piano Teacher
            isn’t quite so oblique but it’s definitely a challenging watch.
            Isabelle Huppert’s performance is one to be studied. In fact, there
            are several actors that have referenced this performance as
            inspiration for their own award-winning performances. I do wonder,
            though, with an actor of this calibre, how do you say, “Um, Mrs.
            Huppert, in this scene I’m gonna need you to masturbate feverishly
            while huffing a stranger’s discarded sperm-soaked tissue.” I’m just
            glad we have someone like Haneke to ask the tough questions.
